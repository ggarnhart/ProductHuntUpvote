# ProductHuntUpvote
A Product Hunt Upvote Bot in Ruby

Uses the Watir Ruby package to up vote Product Hunt Products.
Note: Requires a list of Produc-Hunt-Verified Twitter accounts to iterate over. If you have 5 twitter account logins with Product Hunt Accounts, then you can upvote the product 5 times.

*Please do not abuse this. Product Hunt rocks - this was meant only to be used as a learning experiment for the Ruby Programming Language.*
